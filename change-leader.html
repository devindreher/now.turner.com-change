    <h4>How We React to Change</h4>
</div>

<div class="main-idea">
    <h3>Change vs. Transition</h3>
    <p>A <i>transition</i> is internal &mdash; it's what happens in your minds as we go through changes. Ironically, transitions begin with an <i>ending</i> (losing or letting go), then shift into a <i>neutral zone</i> where we might feel confused or disconnected. The last stage of a transition is the <i>new beginning</i> where we take hold and grow familiar with our new realities.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="hero">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tpd-images/Stages-of-Transition.png">
</div>
<br>
<h3>Signs of a Transition</h3>
<p>You'll often see an increase in these 5 signs during the <i>ending</i> or <i>neutral zones</i>. Of course, there's an acronym to remember them: <b>GRASS</b>.</p>
<br>
<ol class="change">
    <li><h4>Guilt.</h4><p>Change creates winners and losers. Winners can feel guilty for benefitting from a change.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Resentment.</h4><p>Starting and recycling malicious behaviors, passive-aggressive behaviors, or sabotage.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Anxiety.</h4><p>People get anxious. That anxiety can linger until post-change. They may grow edgy and may overreact to events or occurrences.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Self-Absorption.</h4><p>Transitions turn a person's focus back on his/herself and undermines the teamwork. Office doors get closed and people start working on their resumes.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Stress.</h4><p>Teams may experience increased absenteeism, worker compensation claims, and use of employee assistance programs.</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="small-gap">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="separation-2">
    <h4>Being a Change Sponsor</h4>
</div>

<div class="main-idea">
    <p>For an organizational change to be successful, sponsors must demonstrate strong, decisive commitment to the project. Strong commitment is vital so that the agents and targets are effective.</p>
</div>

<br>

<h3>1. Developing a Communications Plan</h3>
<p>Sooner or later, you'll have to talk to your team about the change. Answering these <i>4P</i> questions will help you craft your communications that'll move your team from complying with the change to being committed.</p>
<br>

<h4>Purpose.</h4>
<ul class="change">
    <li>Why are we doing this?</li>
    <li>What would happen if the organization didn't change?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Picture.</h4>
<ul class="change">
    <li>What will "the other side" look like?</li>
    <li>What's changing and what's not?</li>
    <li>How will Turner be more effective as a result?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Plan.</h4>
<ul class="change">
    <li>What's going to happen?</li>
    <li>What'll happen 1st? 2nd? 3rd? ... </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Part.</h4>
<ul class="change">
    <li>What's my role?</li>
    <li>How will I be impacted?</li>
    <li>What role can my team play in making this successful?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>2. Preparing Your Responses.</h3>
<p>If you anticipate specific concerns and deal with them early, then you can avoid unnecessary resistance. Thinka bout what you can say about the benefits/realities of the change. Identify anticipated challenges and create messages that will address each. Don't forget to consider how you'll deliver them (e.g., email, face-to-face, phone, etc.)</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Talking With and Listening to Your Team.</h3>
<p>Here are some ideas for when it comes time to connect with your team:</p>
<br>
<ul class="change">
    <li>Hold an initial meeting or conference call with each of your direct reports.</li>
    <li>Hold one-on-one conversations with each direct report.</li>
    <li>Commit to 10 minutes each day to talk with your team about the transformation.</li>
    <li>Hold an off-site meeting with your direct reports.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div class="hero">

</div>
<br>
<div class="warning">
    <h4>Keep in mind...</h4>
    <ul class="change">
        <li>Engage in open and frequent dialog.</li>
        <li>Own the effectiveness of the transformation with your direct reports.</li>
        <li>Get positive "opinion leaders" involved with specific tranformation actions within your department.</li>
        <li>Meet regularly with your direct reports &mdash; individually and collectively &mdash; to understand issues and progress, and to provide feedback for issues.</li>
        <li>Repeat key messages.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to say "I don't know," but follow-up with when you <i>will</i> know.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to body language and probe further to surface concerns and other issues.</li>
        <li>Build an environment for constructive dissent (it's OK to raise problems in a constructive manner).</li>
        <li>Remember that resistance is normal &mdash; don't discount people's losses, nor belittle or rush over their feelings.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<hr>
<h3>4. Checking-In &amp; Propelling Success</h3>
<p>Here are some ideas for monitoring progress:</p>
<br>
<ul class="change">
    <li>Pay attention to how people respond to the change activities.</li>
    <li>Ensure that positive efforts are recognized and rewarded.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div class="hero">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tpd-images/Checking-In.png">
</div>
<div class="warning">
    <h4>Keep in mind...</h4>
    <ul class="change">
        <li>Recognize that people who make early efforts and are positive and constructive, even if they're results fall short.</li>
        <li>Recognize and reward the people who reinforce the culture while achieving results.</li>
        <li>Make it your job to hunt down and remove barriers to the transformation.</li>
        <li>Confront fellow managers and leaders who undercut the change.</li>
        <li>Be paitent.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<br>
<div class="warning">
    <h4>Identifying resistance.</h4>
    <ul class="change">
        <li><b>Engage in two-way communications with the employees impacted by the change.</b> This can include Q&amp;A sessions, interviews, brainstorming sessions, group meetings, and one-on-one encounters to identify sensitivities and resistance.</li>
        <li><b>Interview managers responsible for past changes.</b> Collect data to assist in determining the groups and locations where resistance has been historically evident.</li>
        <li><b>Gauge reactions, watch body language, and pay attention to casual remarks.</b> Resistance may exist in a subtle, but consequential way.</li>
        <li><b>Set deliverables and monitor their progress.</b> Missed deadlines, missed meetings, absenteeism, illness, lack of cooperation, indifference, and poor performance may be symptoms of resistance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Coaching Through Change</h4>
</div>

<div class="main-idea">
    <p>If you have someone who's struggling with the change, reflect on what you've noticed then answer the questions below:</p>
</div>
<br>
<ol class="change">
    <li>What behaviors is the person demonstrating right now? Specifically, what is this individual saying and doing related to the changes?</li>
    <li>Based on these behaviors, what do you believe may be the underlying cause of their fear or resistance?</li>
    <li>What stage of the transition (i.e., ending, neutral, new beginning) do you think this person may be in? What signs of transition do you see?</li>
    <li>What actions would be appropriate for you to take in order to help this person accept and participate in the change?</li>
</ol>
